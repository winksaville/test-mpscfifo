/**
 * A MpscFifo is a wait free/thread safe multi-producer
 * single consumer first in first out queue. This algorithm
 * is from Dimitry Vyukov's non intrusive MPSC code here:
 *   http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues/non-intrusive-mpsc-node-based-queue
 *
 * The fifo has a head and tail, the elements are added
 * to the head of the queue and removed from the tail.
 * To allow for a wait free algorithm a stub element is used
 * so that a single atomic instruction can be used to add and
 * remove an element. Therefore, when you create a queue you
 * must pass in an areana which is used to manage the stub.
 *
 * A consequence of this algorithm is that when you add an
 * element to the queue a different element is returned when
 * you remove it from the queue. Of course the contents are
 * the same but the returned pointer will be different.
